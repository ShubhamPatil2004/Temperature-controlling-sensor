# Temperature-controlling-sensor
 Architected a real-time temperature monitoring system using the ATmega328P microcontroller pro grammed via Arduino IDE, optimized for precise environmental sensing. · Interfaced LM35 sensor to the ATmega328P analog input, converting its 10mV/°C output to accurate Celsius data using firmware. Supports 55°C to +150°C range.
